# hw3 README - Recursion, Stacks, Heaps, and Heap Application

 * llfilter: filters out nodes according to the pivot value provided, splits the list into a smaller and larger list
 * llrec: uses comparator to delete nodes, uses head recursion
 * stack: created templated stack that inherts from vector
 * Heaps: used comparator, created min and max heap, prominent methods: trickleUp and heapify (trickledown)
 * Logic Gate: created uml diagrams and the logic gate pngs
